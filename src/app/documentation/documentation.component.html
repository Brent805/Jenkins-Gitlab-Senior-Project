            </h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">The current integration between Jenkins and GitLab at GE HealthCare has
              a significant deficiency. When new branches, or GitLab Merge Requests, are created, Jenkins treats them as
              new projects but fails to consider any changes made from the branch point (for branches) or against the
              target branch during the first build. This results in Jenkins pipelines that conditionally run build
              stages based on specific file changes not working properly during the first build.
              ​</p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">When the process fails all the way on main instead of the first build,
              for simple things it takes about 15 minutes, cost of creating another merge request and getting it
              reviewed again makes it take like an hour or 2, may cascade and slow down many more developers with the
              breaking of builds.

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">
              To add this new feature in the most non-disruptive way possible, we added a new optional SCM extension -
              something that was already defined by the original creators as an easy way to modify the execution of the
              Git to Jenkins system. This allowed our new feature to be optionally toggled and be present as an option
              in the GUI alongside other similar optional features.
              This feature is now called FirstBuildChangelog, and its functionality pertains only to the first build of
              a new branch of Jenkins builds. When enabled, the first build of a new branch now reports its head commit
              to the changelog, populating it and allowing for pipeline operations that are dependent on having a
              populated changelog to run instead of failing on the first build. After the first build, the changelog is
              populated based off of the difference between the previous build and the current build as normal
